This is my pet-project. 

I  have created restaurant administration app.
In this project I use React, Redux, Redux-thunk, React-Router and Ant-Design.

Here you can do all CRUD-operations with Orders, Waiters, Dishes and Tables. All updates are saved on the server.
 
There are files with classes for fetching data from server in API-folder.
There are extra files and folders such as columns(with functions which returns colums for tables), form-rules(with rules for forms), order-functions(with functions which return total bill sum and dish list) and other extra files in EXTRA-folder.
You can find all routes which I use in my project in ROUTES-folder.
There are actions, reducers and selectors for Redux in STORE-folder.
